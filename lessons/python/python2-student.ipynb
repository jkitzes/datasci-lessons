As part of this survey, volunteers have driven cars along fixed routes once a year for the past forty years, stopping periodically along the way and counting all of the birds that they see when they do. The particular data tables that we'll work with today summarize the number of birds of many different species that were counted along routes in the state of California.

    "__Tip:__ It's often a good idea to take a large data set and extract a small portion of it to use while building and testing your analysis code. Small data sets can be analyzed faster and allow you to see, visually, what the \"right answer\" should be when you write code to perform analysis. Determining whether your function gives the right answer on a small data set is the core idea behind unit testing, which we'll discuss later."
