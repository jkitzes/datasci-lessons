Logistic growth produces a classic S shaped curve in which a population initially grows very fast, then slows down over time until it reaches a steady state value known as the carrying capacity.\n",

    "For example, when there are only few bears in the woods and lost of food, they reproduce very fast. As the woods get full of bears and food gets harder to find, growth slows until the number of bears just balances with the amount of food (and hunters) in the woods, at which point the population stops growing.\n",

    "1. Write a for loop to calculate and store the values of `nt` for 100 time steps. HINT: Use the `range` function to pick the number of time steps. For each step, append the new population value to a list called `n`. What indexing strategy can you use to get the last value of the list each time around the for loop?\n",

Increment the step counter within the loop so that you have a record of what step the calculation stopped at."

    "Let's introduce some element of randomness into our population growth model. We'll model a simple \"catastrophe\" process, in which a catastrophe happens in 10% of the time steps that reduces the population back down to the initial size. Copy your code from Exercise 4 into the box below, and do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inside your for loop, add a variable called `cata`, for catastrophe, that will be True if a catastrophe has occurred, and False if it hasn't. A simple way to do this is to generate a pseudorandom number between 0 and 1 using `rnd.random()`. Check whether this number is less than 0.1 - this check will be True 10% of the time.\n",
    "1. Using your boolean variable `cata`, add an if statement to your for loop that checks whether `cata` is true in each time step. If it is true, set the population back to the initial size. Otherwise, perform the usual logistic growth calculation.\n",
    "1. Plot your results. Run the cell again to see a different random population growth path.\n",

    "__Bonus__\n",

    "\n",
    "One way to write a program is to simply string together commands, like the ones above, in one long file, and then to run that file to generate your results. This may work, but it can be cognitively difficult to follow the logic of programs written in this style. Also, it does not allow you to reuse your code easily - for example, what if we wanted to run our logistic growth model for several different choices of initial parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important ways to \"chunk\" code into more manageable pieces is to create functions and then to gather these functions into your own modules, and eventually packages. Below we will discuss how to create functions and modules. A third common type of \"chunk\" in Python is classes, but we will not be covering object-oriented programming in this workshop."

    "\n",
    "Finally, let's turn our logistic growth model into a function that we can use over and over again. Copy your code from Exercise 5 into the box below, and do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Turn your code into a function called `logistic_growth` that takes four arguments: `r`, `K`, `n0`, and `p` (the probability of a catastrophe). Make `p` a keyword argument with a default value of 0.1. Have your function return the `n` list of population sizes.\n",
    "1. In a subsequent cell, call your function with different values of the parameters to make sure it works. Store the returned value of `n` and make a plot from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Bonus__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Refactor your function by pulling out the line that actually performs the calculation of the new population given the old population. Make this line another function called `grow_one_step` that takes in the old population, `r`, and `K`, and returns the new population. Have your `logistic_growth` function use the `grow_one_step` function to calculate the new population in each time step."
